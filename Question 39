Explain the difference between subsets and permutations with examples.
Answer -

Concept              | Subsets                                                                                                | Permutations
Definition           | A subset is any selection of elements from a set (including the empty set and the full set).           | A permutation is an arrangement of all or part of the elements, where order matters.
Order                | Order does not matter.                                                                                 | Order does matter.
Count                | For a set of n elements, there are 2^n subsets.                                                        | For a set of n elements, there are n! permutations.
Includes Empty?      | Yes, the empty set is a valid subset.                                                                  |No, permutations do not include an empty arrangement.
Use-Case             | Useful when you want to explore groups or combinations of elements.                                    | Useful when you want to explore arrangements or sequences.

 Example
Given the array:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[1, 2, 3]

Subsets: (Order doesn't matter)

css
Copy
Edit
[]
[1]
[2]
[3]
[1, 2]
[1, 3]
[2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
Total: 2^3 = 8 subsets

 Permutations: (Order matters)

csharp
Copy
Edit
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 3, 2]
[2, 1, 3]
[2, 3, 1]
[3, 1, 2]
[3, 2, 1]
Total: 3! = 6 permutations
