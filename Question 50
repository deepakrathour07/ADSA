Explain the concept of equilibrium index and its applications in array problems.

Answer-

An equilibrium index in an array is a position i such that:

Sum of elements before i == Sum of elements after i
Formally:

arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1] + arr[i + 2] + ... + arr[n - 1]
At the equilibrium index, the array is perfectly balanced around that index â€” the total of all numbers to the left equals the total of all numbers to the right.

Applications in Algorithm Design


Equilibrium indices are used in:


Application	Purpose

Balancing Problems                       	To detect positions of equal weight or distribution.
Financial Analysis                         Find breaking points in profit-loss data.
Load Balancing in Distributed Systems    	Decide cut points where load is balanced across servers.
Partitioning Arrays                   	Used in partition logic for optimization problems.
Game Design                            	For computing balanced positions or symmetry in scores
