Explain the concept of priority queues and their applications in algorithm design. 
Answer-

A priority queue is a special type of abstract data structure where each element is associated with a priority, and elements are served based on their 
priority rather than just their insertion order (like in a regular queue).

Elements with higher priority are dequeued before those with lower priority.

If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their insertion order (this depends on the implementation).

pplications in Algorithm Design
Priority queues are heavily used in many classic algorithms! Here are some key examples:


Algorithm	Purpose of Priority Queue-

Dijkstra's Algorithm	              To repeatedly select the unvisited node with the lowest distance from the start.
A Search Algorithm*	                To select the next node to explore based on the lowest estimated cost.
Prim's Algorithm	                  To select the edge with the minimum weight to grow the Minimum Spanning Tree.
Huffman Coding                  	  To repeatedly combine the two lowest frequency nodes to build an optimal prefix code tree.
CPU Task Scheduling	                To pick the next task based on priority level (e.g., shortest job first).
Event-Driven Simulation	            To process the next event in order of scheduled time.
