Explain the sliding window technique and its applications in array problems. 
Answer -

The Sliding Window is a commonly used algorithmic strategy to solve problems involving subarrays, substrings, or contiguous segments of a larger dataset.

Applications

Problem Type	Example

Fixed window sum / max / min	Maximum in every window of size k
Variable window — condition based	Smallest subarray with sum ≥ target
Substrings in strings	Longest substring without repeating characters
Subarrays with constraints	Number of subarrays with sum exactly k

Time Complexity	Often O(n)
Space Complexity	O(1) or O(k)
