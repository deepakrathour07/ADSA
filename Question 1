1. Explain the concept of a prefix sum array and its applications. 
A prefix sum array is a technique used to precompute cumulative sums of an array, so that you can quickly calculate the sum of any subarray (or range) later on.
Applications:
Range Sum Queries:

Quickly answer multiple queries like “what’s the sum between index l and r?”

Time complexity: O(1) per query after O(n) preprocessing.

Counting Frequencies:

Useful in problems where you need to compute how many items fall into a specific range.

2D Prefix Sum:

Extends to matrices for calculating submatrix sums.

Sliding Window Problems:

Helps simplify or speed up calculations of sums over sliding windows.

Difference Arrays:

Prefix sums are the inverse of difference arrays (useful in range update scenarios).

Probability and Statistics:

Useful for calculating cumulative distributions or expectations.
