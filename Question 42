Explain the concept of dynamic programming and its use in solving the maximum subarray problem
Answer -

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a problem-solving technique used to efficiently solve problems that have:

Overlapping Subproblems — The problem can be broken down into smaller, repeating subproblems.

Optimal Substructure — The global optimal solution can be built from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.


Maximum Subarray Problem
Problem statement:
Given an array of integers (positive, negative, or zero), find the contiguous subarray that has the largest sum.

For example:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6.
